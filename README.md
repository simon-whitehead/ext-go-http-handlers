ext-go-http-handlers
====================

Companion code to my blog post about extending default HTTP handlers in Go available here: http://simonsdotnet.wordpress.com/2014/09/06/extending-gos-http-handlers/

This code serves to demonstrate how you might go about providing basic extensions/dependency injection into
your HTTP handlers when working with vanilla net/http.
